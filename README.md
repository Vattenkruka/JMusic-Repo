## Usage

The web application can be used by both regular users and administrative users. 

Regular users get to see and interact with the home page with a search function. 
Administrative users, on the other hand, can use the web application with the help of the Postman application to test different urls and endpoints. 
 
### Homepage:
  ```
   
  ```
The home page displays 5 random artists, genres, and songs. It also has a search function that redirects to the search page. You can only search for song titles in this function. 
### Search page:

The search page shows the results of the query the user entered. It shows the song title together with the artist, album, and genre.
